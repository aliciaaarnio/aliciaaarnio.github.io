			  <h3>I. The solar-stellar connection: characterizing extreme activity in young stars </h3>

The idea that the Sun may be representative of a larger class of "solar type stars"
dates back at least to 1915, when George Hale suggested that there likely exist an untold 
number of solar-type stars exhibiting similar phenomena. The solar-stellar connection 
evolved from this idea, and as stars were discovered which had photospheric, chromospheric, 
and coronal properties closely resembling our nearest star, it was recognized that young, 
solar-like stars represent our Sun in its youth. Indeed, the identification of T Tauri 
Stars (TTS) as “young Suns” is now well established, dating back to Joy (1945). TTS are 
particularly interesting as they range in age from less than a million years (still 
embedded in their natal clouds of gas and dust) to a few tens of Myr in age, around when 
circumstellar disks begin to dissipate. The "solar-stellar" connection for these 
pre-main-sequence (PMS; not yet hydrogen burning) stars is of interest to young-star 
researchers and solar physicists alike: on the one hand we seek to know what the Sun was 
like in the epoch of planet formation, and at the same time the Sun is a uniquely situated 
laboratory for understanding the detailed physics of its more distant PMS analogs.

Flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been observed on the Sun for decades; indeed, 
the potentially catastrophic effects of space weather are more than sufficient motivation 
for continual solar observation and modeling. On young stars, flares hundreds to ten 
thousand times more energetic than solar occur frequently. While solar prominences soar 
around 1 solar radius above the solar surface and CMEs launch from similar radii in the Sun's 
atmosphere, magnetic structures on TTS---post-flare loops and prominences---can extend tens of 
stellar radii from the star's surface. The discovery of such large magnetic structures arose 
from solar-stellar analogy, applying solar flare models to the X-ray light curve data from 
young stars (e.g., Reale et al. 1997). Should extended loops destabilize in prominence 
eruptions---which are, in the classical description of solar CMEs the “bright core” of the 
CME---at these radii, the loops would act as extended lever arms from which ejected mass can 
apply substantial torque against stellar rotation, depending upon the event frequency and 
mass lost per event.

Given the observational difficulty in directly detecting stellar CMEs 
(e.g., Leitzinger et al. 2010), we used solar flare and CME data to see if the much more 
easily observable stellar flares could allow us to infer stellar CME rates. In Aarnio et al. 
(2011), we established a relationship between flare energy and CME mass for associated solar 
flares and CMEs. Our premise was that as flares and CMEs are both products of impulsive 
magnetic reconnection events, if a flare and CME are associated, they should have correlated 
properties. This is indeed what our study found: for flare-associated CMEs, as the flare 
energy increased, CME masses also increased.

			  </div>
This correlation of flare energy 
and CME mass holds a consistent log-linear relationship over four orders of magnitude in 
flare energy and almost three in CME mass. Our work also confirmed that the frequency of 
association increased with flare energy: almost every X-class flare in our sample was 
CME-associated.

Early stellar angular momentum evolution remains an outstanding problem, as stars are clearly 
not conserving angular momentum as they contract toward the main sequence. In Aarnio, Matt, 
& Stassun (2012), we quantified what mass loss rates may be in young Suns via CMEs, and then 
further assessed what kind of torque that may apply against stellar rotation. We found that 
in the first few million years, as the protostar is still accreting, CMEs cannot liberate enough 
angular momentum to compete against spin up due to contraction and accretion. Once contraction 
has slowed and accretion stopped, around 10 Myr, CMEs could slow stellar rotation if their mass 
loss rate is ~10^-10 solar masses per year.

The work we have done thus far clearly applies to young stars that are like the Sun: now, we 
aim to determine how a solar-mass relationship can be extended to stars less than one solar 
mass. These stars are of great interest in terms of planet formation because the habitable 
zones become closer to the star (and thus more vulnerable to CMEs) with decreasing stellar mass. 
Once we reach the M dwarf mass regime, another interesting factor comes into play: unlike 
solar-type stars, M dwarfs exhibit elevated levels of activity for longer fractions of their 
lives. Planets around M dwarfs are the subjects of much study recently because the habitable

zones of M dwarfs place their planets dangerously close to their very active host stars. 
Understanding the rate of activity and the effects on the circumstellar environment is critical 
for characterizing whether these planets could host life.

Additionally, we seek to determine how these extreme levels of activity evolve with time. In 
the figures above, we show properties of solar and stellar flares and
mass ejections and their proxies. In these 
data, we believe we're seeing hints of the evolution of these properties, although due to biases 
inherent to surveys of these phenomena, we lack data for solar-type stars of intermediate ages 
(~50Myr to a few Gyr). Figure 2 adds to the extensive literature supporting 
the idea that the fundamental physics of flares and CMEs does not depend on the star hosting the
event. It is less clear, however, how the energetics should scale, and why the frequencies should
be so similar across stellar masses. With the availability of Kepler archival data, and, in 
the future, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, my students and I will be able to search for flare 
rates for this undersurveyed stellar age range.

<h3>II. Accretion and outflows in the limit of weak stellar magnetic fields: does the 
magnetospheric accretion paradigm apply to Herbig AeBe stars?</h3>

Herbig AeBe stars are identified as the higher mass pre-main sequence counterparts to TTS 
(Herbig, 1960). Herbig's initial criteria in identifying these objects included a spectral 
type earlier than F0, emission components in the Balmer series (as in the TTS case), positions 
near molecular clouds so as to select only young stars, and nebulosity around the star, 
indicating the star's proximity to its natal cloud. Herbig AeBe stars also show evidence for 
substantial circumstellar disk material, including infrared, submillimeter, and millimeter 
continuum excesses; the kinematic properties of forbidden lines thought to originate in the 
disk indicate Keplerian velocity structure (Acke et al. 2005). Excess UV luminosity from 
accretion shocks (Calvet \& Gullbring, 1998) and redshifted spectral line features (Grinin et 
al. 2001) indicate infalling material, and powerful winds are evident in P-Cygni absorption 
features. As the overall evolution of higher mass stars proceeds more quickly than lower mass 
stars, the disk dissipation timescale for HAeBe stars is shorter than observed for TTS 
(Hernandez et al. 2005).

In the presently adopted magnetospheric accretion (MA) paradigm, originally developed in the 
context of TTS (e.g., Konigl, 1991; Shu et al. 1994; Hartmann et al. 1994), a ~1kG, large-scale 
dipolar stellar magnetosphere truncates the circumstellar disk; field lines at the disk serve 
as a conduit for material free-falling to the stellar surface in an accretion flow. 
Fundamentally, this MA model depends on a strong, highly ordered dipolar field capable of 
meeting disk material a few stellar radii from the star. Sufficiently strong fields of ~1kG are 
observed on TTS (e.g., Basri et al. 1992; Johns-Krull et al. 1999; Johns-Krull, 2007, to name 
but a few), but of the ~70 HAeBe stars with longitudinal field measurements to date,
only ~10% have any detected field at all, and in those which do have fields, they are weak: ~100G
(Hubrig et al. 2009, Alecian et al. 2013). In fact, magnetic field measurements for PMS stars over a 
range of masses have revealed that polar dipole strength decreases dramatically with increasing 
mass (Gregory et al. 2012); these weak fields call into question the viability of the MA paradigm
for HAeBe stars.

Strong outflows for TTS and HAeBe stars, thought to be magnetically driven (e.g., Pudritz & Norman, 
1983), are evident in observations across many wavelengths (e.g., optical and UV emission lines, 
3.6cm continuum emission; Skinner et al. 1993). Estimated mass loss rates for Herbig AeBe stars 
from infrared recombination lines and molecular outflow lines range from 10^-6 and 10^-8  solar masses per year
(Nisini et al. 1995), substantially higher than mass loss measurements for TTS 
(~10^-12 to 10^-10 solar masses per year; cf. Muzerolle et al. 2000; Dupree et al. 2005). 
The origin of these outflows, however, remains ambiguous: does the stellar field mediate the mass 
flux out of the system (Cranmer, 2009) or a disk wind (Shu et al. 1994; Konigl & Pudritz, 2000; 
Ray et al. 2007)?
%link between magnetically driven accretion and winds.
How does the weaker stellar magnetic field 
for Herbig AeBe stars modify the physical conditions where the winds are launched? How does this 
effect the relative fraction of material accreted versus put into the outflow? How does this change 
interpretation of optical emission lines? Recent advances in optical and infrared interferometry, 
in conjunction with high-quality echelle spectroscopy, offer a fresh avenue for seeking answers to 
these open questions.

Our group has compiled a rich set of optical spectroscopy, near-infrared spectroscopy, and 
near-infrared interferometric data. Presently, we have optical spectra for 57 stars, contemporaneous 
near-infrared spectra for 38 of those objects, and interferometric observations for 49 stars. The 
vast majority of targets in our sample are Herbig AeBe stars; a few TTS and intermediate mass TTS 
(iMTTS) are included to supplement available interferometric data.

Our optical spectroscopic data set (Aarnio et al., in prep) was collected using the MIKE 
(Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle) spectrograph at Magellan Observatory. The blue side of MIKE 
covers a ~3200-5000A range, with a resolving power R~80,000; the red chip spans 
~4900-10000A with R~65,000. 
  Within our large spectroscopic data set, some objects were observed at multiple epochs;
we obtained follow up time-series MIKE data of a Herbig Ae star (V1295 Aquila) as well as a Herbig Be
star (HD 98922). 
Herbig AeBe targets are ideal for time-series spectroscopy, as their intrinsic brightness allows for 
high cadence sequential observations; our cadence is primarily limited by the chip read-out 
time. We see strong, short timescale variability (~hours) in the Balmer 
series lines:

  Fig. 3 shows H-alpha variance profiles for both stars; of note, the
blueshifted absorption features show the most variability on all timescales probed. We also note 
potential detections of transient emission features in [O I] (a preliminary 
discussion is presented in Aarnio et al. 2014). Our spectra also include lines of various ionization 
potentials which allow us to probe the full spatial extent of the wind, from the hotter, higher density 
material in the launching region to the cooler, more tenuous gas in the expansion region (e.g., Powell 
et al. 2012).

	I am using the radiative transfer model TORUS (Transport Of Radiation Under Sobolev; Harries 2000)
to, for a set of system parameters (star, disk, wind, and magnetosphere), simultaneously produce dust 
continuum images, SEDs, and atomic line transfer calculations. From the continuum images, I am
constructing visibilities to compare with the interferometric data for these sources, 
SEDs to compare to those already generated by my UM undergraduate researcher with photometry available
in the literature, and the line 
transfer models we can compare to our MIKE spectra. The combined interferometric and spectroscopic 
data sets we have gathered uniquely position us to break key degeneracies in the modeling of PMS 
systems, namely, disk size and inclination.

In the left panel of 
Figure 4, I show a star, magnetosphere, and disk wind model initialization from
TORUS. The magnetosphere and wind are color-coded in log(density) space, and the star (and accretion
hotspot) have colors corresponding to temperature. 
As is evident in the figure, TORUS uses Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) to save on computational expense;
it is also parallelized. An average line transfer
model takes approximately 3 hours to run in parallel on my 20 core desktop workstation; having access
to the Janus supercomputer at CU would allow me to generate grids of models in order to perform
robust parameter space analyses (e.g., Kurosawa, Harries & Symington, 2006). In earlier work, I used
the Vanderbilt University ACCRE cluster to run T Tauri Star Radiative Equilibrium (TTSRE, written by
Whitney et al. 2003a & 2003b; my related work using the code appears in Aarnio et al. 2010) star+disk
models (a spectral energy distribution grid was developed with this code by Robitaille et al. 2006).

While TORUS is a powerful and flexible code which can model a number of astrophysical scenarios
for the purposes of the young stellar object group at UM, 
a particularly compelling feature of the TORUS code is its modular design: each source and sink
is self-contained within its own plug-and-play module. This framework readily allows for the development
of new modules, which we are undergoing right now. The current public release of TORUS includes a
T Tauri-inspired magnetospheric accretion module; we are working to develop Herbig AeBe star specific
modules. 
These modules under development include
a magnetosphere with realistic geometry (Fig. 6; our collaborators in this effort are Scott
Gregory, Gaitee Hussain, and Evelyne Alecian), a stellar wind module; presently only a Blandford and Payne-style
disk wind is implemented), and a dusty wind to allow for transient opacity sources with which to reconstruct
time variability.
