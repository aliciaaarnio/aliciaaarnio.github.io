		  George Ellery Hale was born June 29, 1868. His remarkable focus and intense drive are often
		  cited by biographers. From The Perfect Machine: "Abbot wasn't the first to discover that George
		  Hale, a mild-mannered, self-effacing man, who looked almost cherubic in his tiny wire-rimmed
		  glasses, usually got his way."
		  George Hale likely is responsible for founding observatories, professional 
		  societies, and journals that astronomers benefit from to this day. Behind his childhood home, Hale
		  built his own lab which he then turned into Kenwood Observatory, dedicated in 1891 when he was
		  22 years
		  old. He founded 
		  Yerkes Observatory in 1897, Mount Wilson Observatory in 1917, the Hale
		  Solar Lab in 1923, and Mount Palomar Observatory in 1923. He built the 
		  successively larger (and largest in the world at their time) telescopes within, ever driven to
		  build bigger and bigger telescopes, the idea for the next already in his mind before the current
		  was even completed. He founded the
		  International Astronomical Union as well as what is now known as Astronomy and Astrophysics
		  (formerly, A&A was known as the Sidereal Messenger) and the Astrophysical Journal.</br>
		  <br>
		  
		  Hale had a vision for astrophysics, a then newly emerging field. His mentor, British astronomer
		  William Huggins, noted that astrophysics began with spectroscopy, when observatories "took on the
		  appearance of a laboratory" where terrestrial and stellar chemistry meet. Hale used spectroscopy
		  to discover Zeeman splitting in sunspots in 1908, detecting for the first time their magnetic fields. 
		  He also observed Calcium lines in prominences, and used his multi-wavelength observations to deduce
		  the differing scale heights of structures in the solar atmosphere.</br>
		  <br>
		  
		  It must be noted, Hale had a particularly privileged position being from a wealthy family (his
		  father built elevators during Chicago's building boom): a colleague pointed out at the opening
		  of Hale's Kenwood Observatory that Hale had the advantage of being able to try 10% odds experiments as
		  he had no one to answer to.</br>
		  <br>
		  
		  Hale's biographers have noted that he suffered from insomnia, debilitating headaches,
		  and depression. Before his retirement as director of Mount Wilson Observatory, he complained of
		  "visits of the tormenting demon," a small man who would appear and criticize and disparage him.
		  Hale was able to live with these challenges and accomplish incredible feats in his life. Today,
		  astronomers in the <a href="http://accessastronomy.blogspot.com" alt="Link to access: astronomy blog">Access: Astronomy</a>
		  group and the AAS WGAD are working to build support
		  infrastructure to make sure astronomers now with mental health issues can have access to the help
		  they need and can continue to contribute to the field.</br>
