			 <p>In 2015, a group of astronomers at
			   <a href="https://vanderbilt.irisregistration.com/Home/Site?code=InclusiveAstronomy2015">Inclusive Astronomy</a> meeting got together and began drafting
			  a proposal to create a <a href="http://wgad.aas.org">Working Group on Accessibility and Disability (WGAD)</a>. The proposal was
			  submitted to the AAS in November of 2015 and the group was accepted by the council and
			    officially formed by the Society in January of 2016.</p>

			 <p>The 2010 US Census
			   found that 19% of Americans identify as having a disability. In a given year, upwards of a
			   quarter of American adults experience mental illnesses. Yet, within STEM disciplines generally,
			   representation is low beginning at the undergraduate level and continually decreasing along
			   the academic career path.

The pies show undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral level studies, with the slices representing students with disabilities becoming vanishingly small: 9-10% at the undergraduate level, 5% at the graduate level, and 1% at the doctorate level."></a>
In a survey of the AAS membership in 2013, 2% of the membership reported having a disability
including mobility or hearing limitations. An equal fraction preferred to not respond to the question. While
these respondents had reasons we cannot discern for non-response, we must recognize that disability is stigmatized
in our society and that likely prevents many from disclosing. This is troubling for many reasons, not the least of
which is that non-disclosure could then prevent access to resources.

First line: I am deaf or have serious difficulty hearing: 1% of membership, 21 respondents, answered yes. 
Second line: I am blind or have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses: 0% of membership, or 2 respondents, answered yes. 
Third line: I have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs: 1% of membership, or 14 respondents, answered yes. 
Fourth line: None of the above: 96% of membership, or 1,472 respondents, answered yes. 
Fifth line: 2% of membership, or 26 respondents, preferred not to respond."></a></p>

			 <p>WGAD's charge is to identify and then eliminate barriers to access that exclude astronomers
			   with disabilities from engaging with astronomy. WGAD recognizes the complex identities of
			   astronomers include more than just where we are along the axis of ability, and aims to work in
			   an intersectional manner, addressing how ableism and racism, sexism, classism, and
			   heteronormativity can compound and build higher barriers to access. In a multi-faceted approach,
			   WGAD aims to raise awareness of disability history, the prevalence of ableism, and to prevent
			   erasure. We are also working to promote accessibility across all platforms used to engage with 
			   astronomy: presentations,
			   <a href="https://wgad.aas.org/sites/wgad.aas.org/files/Recommendations_WGAD_2016.pdf">publications</a>, websites, and software, for a few examples.</p>
