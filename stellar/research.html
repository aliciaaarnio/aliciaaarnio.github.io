  <p>Here I give brief summaries of a few major research projects I'm involved in. The overarching theme tying
    together these projects is an interest in how magnetic fields mediate the flux of mass and energy within
    a star-disk system: my work focuses on activity, outflows, and accretion. I use large data sets and the
    solar-stellar connection to understand stars like the Sun when it was a few million years old and how it
    evolved to be the star we know now.
    At the same time, my stellar results inform possible solar extremes. I observe, taking photometric and
    spectroscopic data, run radiative transfer models and construct spectral energy distributions to understand
    the data I've gathered.</p>

<p><h4>The Solar-Stellar Connection</h4>
  Our closest star gives us a unique view into the physics that govern properties of and events on far
  away stellar counterparts. I've used an astronomer's big data approach to analyze high quality, long
  temporal baseline solar data to estimate the rates and properties of coronal mass ejections on solar-like
  stars (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011SoPh..268..195A">2011, <em>Solar Physics</em></a>). I then used those rate estimates to see if it is possible, due
  to the apparently scaled up levels of activity and magnetic structure size scales, for these stellar
  CMEs to liberate enough angular momentum to explain observed slower rotation of the most active pre-main
  sequence Suns (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760....9A">2012, <em>ApJ</em></a>). I'm currently working on compiling additional solar data to continue
  these explorations.</p>

  <p><h4>Star-Disk Interaction</h4>
    The work that motivated me to study the effects of coronal mass ejections on young stars
    began with the discovery of large-scale post-X-ray flare magnetic loop structures. These
    structures, up to tens of stellar radii in extent, were thought to be the clearest evidence of
    direct star-disk interaction. We modeled SEDs in an effort to determine the inner edges of the
    dust disks of these stars (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...717...93A">2010, <em>ApJ</em></a>)
    and looked for signs of ongoing accretion as indicators of potential gas within the dust disks.
    Overall, we didn't find evidence for disk material, dust or gas, close enough to be within reach
    of the magnetic loops.</p>

  <p><h4>Large-scale magnetic structures</h4>
    Upon realizing the large scale loops were not anchored to circumstellar disk material, 
    we turned to solar mechanical equilibrium models for an explanation. These models balance internal
    and external gas and magnetic pressures to determine the physical conditions in which a magnetic
    loop can be stable. For the solar case, the model showed cool prominences could reach great heights
    in the corona, but hot loops (like those observed on TTS) were confined to heights below the source
    surface. We altered the model to include appropriate physical parameters for TTS and added a term,
    a scaled-up solar wind, to be more representative of the physical conditions
    on a young Sun and found that indeed, we could produce stable hot loops multiple stellar radii in
    extent, no external disk support needed.

  <p><h4>Magnetospheric accretion across the H-R diagram</h4>
    Moving up to higher mass pre-main sequence stars, most recently, I've been studying
    magnetospheric accretion in Herbig AeBe stars. These stars are particularly interesting as so few
    (~10%) have detectable azimuthally averaged magnetic fields. Yet, in our optical spectroscopic data,
    we see very similar line profiles to their lower mass pre-main sequence counterparts. What we don't
    see, however, is redshifted absorption indicative of accretion via large-scale dipolar field. Our
    high cadence variability study (<em>ApJ</em>, in press soon) shows the majority of the action is
    happening on the blue sides of the observed spectral lines. At the high resolution of our data, we
    see rich substructure in the P-Cygni absorption components.

  <p><h4>Stellar populations: finding, characterizing associations and moving groups</h4>
    My first large data set project involved a spectroscopic survey of ~50 stars potentially associated
    with the HD 141569 triple system (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AJ....136.2483A">2008, <em>AJ</em></a>).
    With the spectra, we searched for indicators of youth (Halpha in emission, Lithium absorption
    showing the stars were too young to have destroyed it via convection) and measured radial velocities
    to input to kinematic models searching for a comoving group. 
    More recently, I worked on a survey to find new members of Rho Ophiucus and Chamaeleon
    (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459.1363J">2016, <em>MNRAS</em></a>). In this work,
    we also modeled spectral energy distributions of the sample stars.</p>

  <p><h4>Collaboration work</h4>
    I am currently a co-I on a GPI Large and Long Program to observe Herbig AeBe stars. This work is adding
    to the large array of data gathered over the past decade by our YSO team led by John Monnier. Together,
    collaborators at the University of Michigan, University of Exeter, CU Boulder, Georgia State University, Boston
    University, Princeton, the CfA, American Museum of Natural History, Rice University, NRAO, and the Max
    Planck Institute for Astronomy are working to better understand Herbig AeBe stars, the innermost 
    regions of their circumstellar disks, and whether they host planets.
